              <h4>ARE YOU HAPPY?</h4>
              <p>Gross National Happiness is a way of measuring one aspect of a nation’s success overlooked by Gross Domestic Product, the traditional measurement used for comparing nations. This app is a step towards putting this measurement in place in Canada.</p>
              <p>The greater the number of people that participate, the better the measurement and outcome will be. So please help by using the app and finding out how happy you are. We are currently using a limited number of data sets, as a proof of concept.</p>
              <p>The intent is that, in time, this information could be used to help the government make policy decisions which would lead to a happier population.</p>

              <h4>MEASURING HAPPINESS</h4>
              <p>Gross National Happiness is already an indicator used in Bhutan to guide policy decisions and has been looked at in a number of other jurisdictions. For <a href="http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com" target="_blank">Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness</a> formula they use an extensive survey of 249 questions which fall within 33 different indicators inside 9 different domains.</p><p>The 9 domains used by Bhutan are Psychological well being, Health, Time Use, Education, Cultural Diversity and Resilience, Good Governance, Community Vitality, Ecological Diversity and Resilience, and Living Standard. Each of the domains is weighted equally, but some indicators within them have different weights. For a breakdown of the weighting used, look <a href="http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/docs/GNH/PDFs/Weighting.pdf">here</a>.</p>
              <p>For this app we narrowed the focus down to two domains, Ecological Diversity and Resilience, and Health.  This app has been geared towards the average Canadian and we are working with limited time and data, so we have changed the format and weighting slightly to suit what works for the project, while still attempting to follow the example provided by the GNH website.</p>
              <p>For example the GNH weighs the indicator “Self reported health status” as being worth 10% of the total health domain. We have given this a weighting of 20% in order to allow a greater influence from how a person identifies their own health.</p>
